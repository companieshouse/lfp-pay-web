                <p class="govuk-body-l">Use this service if you've received a penalty notice from Companies House for filing your company's annual accounts late.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">You'll need:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet" id="list-requirements">
                    <li>the company number</li>

                    <li>a credit or debit card</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="govuk-body">You can <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" id="appeals-link" data-event-id="lfp - appeal a penalty link" href="/appeal-a-penalty/">appeal a late filing penalty</a>

                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">It takes around 5 minutes to pay.</p>
